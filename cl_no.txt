React
=====

    - React is the javascript library.
    - React given by facebook.
    - React categorized into following types.
        1) ReactJS
        2) React Native
        3) React Bootstrap
    - ReactJS, used to develop the web applications.
    - React Native used to develop the mobile applications.
    - React Bootstrap used to apply the Rich UI to both Web applications 
    and mobile applications.
    - we will develop ReactJS applications in two ways.
        1) JSX
        2) Typescript
    - JSX stands for javascript and xml.
    - JSX is not the programming language.
    - JSX won't follows the OOPS.
    - Typescript is the Programming Language.
    - Typescript introduced by microsoft.
    - Typescript follows the OOPs.
    - If we develop ReactJS applications with Typescript automatically 
    we are getting OOPs benefits.  
    - we will save Typescript files in ReactJS with ".tsx" extentsion.
            => Typescript + xml
    - Babel is the tool (inbuilt tool for react library) used to convert 
    the Typescript to equivalent javascript.
    - React applications are faster compared to other frameworks
    because of "Virtual DOM".
    - React applications are component based applications.
    - ReactJS divides the applications into multiple components, 
    so automatically modularity increases.
    - React Components are Reusable.
    - As a React Developer, we can provide communication between one
    component to another component.

Environmental Setup
-------------------
    1) NodeJS
        -"npm" stands for node packaging manager.
        -"npm" helps to install the react software.
        -"npx" stands for node packaging runner.
        -"npx" helps to create the react application.

file : node -v14.15.2 -x64.msi 

    2) Yarn tool
        - Yarn tool, used to download the 3rd party libraries.
        > npm install -g Yarn
        => "-g" stands for global installation

    3) install "create-react-app" tool
        -"create-react-app" tool provided by facebook.
        -"create-react-app" tool, helps to create the react application.
        > npm install -g create-react-app

Creating the react application
------------------------------

    1) Create the directory (folder)
    Ex.
        class_applications
    2) switch to class_applications directory
        > cd class_applications
    3) create the react application
        > npx create-react-app first-app --template Typescript
    4) switch to react application
        > cd first-app
    5) execute the react application
        > yarn start
        (or)
        >npm start
            - the default port number of react application is 3000.

    1)node_modules
        - it contains libraries, and these libraries helps to execute the react application
    2) public/favicon.ico 
        - This is the default logo of react
    3) public/index.html
        - React starts the execution from "index.html" file
        - "index.html" file also called as main template
    4) public/logo192.png & logo512.png 
        - These images helps to execute react applications in different resolutions.
    5) public/manifest.json 
        -configure the mobile application.
    6) public/robots.txt
        -used to define the SEO keywords.
    7) src
        -used to deploy the React applications (components)
    8) src/App.tsx 
           App.css 
           App.test.tsx 
        -above files are related to default component. 
        -"App" component is the default component 
    9) src/index.css 
        -used to define the global styles. 
    10) src/index.tsx 
        -This file called as Registration file.
        -All our components should register here.
    11) src/logo.svg 
        -this is the default SVG logo of React application 
    12) src/react-app-env.d.ts 
        -used to configure the Environmental variables. 
    13) src/setupTests.ts 
        - used to write the unit test cases to react components. 
    14) package.json 
        - used to download the 3rd party libraries. 
    15) tsconfig.json 
        - this file representing the typescript configurations.

Component 
---------
    -React application is collabration of Components.
    -As a React Developer, we can create more than one component.
    -As a React Developer, we can provide communication between one component to another component.
    -React supports two types of component.
        1) Functional Level Component (Stateless component)
        2) Class Level Component (statefull component)

Functional Components 
--------------------- 
    -simple "function" behaves like component. 
    -"React" is the predefined "class" provides the "component" environment.
