    - ReactJS, used to develop the web applications.
    - React Native used to develop the mobile applications.
    - React Bootstrap used to apply the Rich UI to both Web applications

    - we will develop ReactJS applications in two ways.
        1) JSX
        2) Typescript
    - JSX stands for javascript and xml.
    - JSX is not the programming language.
    - JSX won't follows the OOPS.
    - Typescript is the Programming Language.
    - Typescript introduced by microsoft.
    - Typescript follows the OOPs.
    - If we develop ReactJS applications with Typescript automatically 
    we are getting OOPs benefits.  
    - we will save Typescript files in ReactJS with ".tsx" extentsion.
            => Typescript + xml
    - Babel is the tool (inbuilt tool for react library) used to convert 
    the Typescript to equivalent javascript.
    - React applications are faster compared to other frameworks
    because of "Virtual DOM".
    - React applications are component based applications.
    - ReactJS divides the applications into multiple components, 
    so automatically modularity increases.
    - React Components are Reusable.
    - As a React Developer, we can provide communication between one
    component to another component.
